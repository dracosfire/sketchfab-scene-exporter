sketchfab-dl-script
===================
The goal of this script is to allow you to export the models contained in a Sketchfab scene to a Blender-ready format without ever leaving the browser.  

Usage:  
  A download button will appear inside the scene viewer (as shown in the image below) when viewing a Sketchfab scene. This appears to only work in Chrome at this time.
  
Installation:  
  If you have a userscript manager installed, clicking on [this link](https://github.com/reinitialized/sketchfab-dl-script/raw/master/sketchfab-dl-script.user.js) should bring up a prompt to install the script.

sketchfab-dl-script
===================

A userscript to export .obj files from Sketchfab.com  

This script allows you to export a .OBJ file from a Sketchfab model viewer page.  

Note:  
  This new version of the script automatically initiates the model download, and also downloads separate .OBJ files for each model in the scene.   
  
  
Usage:  
  While a model is loading on the model viewer page, a javascript alert is displayed by the script, and once the alert is dismissed, the .OBJ files are downloaded. If you do not see the alert after the model is loaded, you should try refreshing the page multiple times. This appears to only work in Chrome at the moment. The following is an image of the alert:

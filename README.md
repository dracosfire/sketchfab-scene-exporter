sketchfab-dl-script
===================

A userscript to export .obj files from Sketchfab.com  

This script allows you to export a .OBJ file from a Sketchfab model viewer page.  

Note:  
  This new version of the script automatically initiates the model download, and also downloads separate .OBJ files for each model in the scene.   
  
  
Usage:  
  If successful, the script should automatically start downloading the models contained in the Sketchfab scene of the model viewer page you are on. If nothing seems to be happening, you should try refreshing the page multiple times. This appears to only work in Chrome at the moment. 
  
Installation:  
  If you have a userscript manager  installed, clicking on [this link](https://github.com/reinitialized/sketchfab-dl-script/raw/master/sketchfab-dl-script.user.js) should bring up a prompt to install the script.  

Todo:  
  Add UV support
